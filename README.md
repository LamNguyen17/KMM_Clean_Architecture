## ðŸš€ Introduction

This sample demonstrates how one can

- Setup base architecture of Flutter app using Clean Architecture
- Use dependency injection for layers separation
- Make api calls using Axios plugin.

#### Dependencies

- [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) : http client
- [Get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) : dependency injection
- [Build runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) : The build_runner package provides a
  concrete way of generating files using Dart code. Files are always generated directly on disk, and
  rebuilds are incremental - inspired by tools such as Bazel
- [Rxdart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) : RxDart extends the capabilities of Dart Streams and
  StreamControllers.
- [Dartz](https://pub.dev/packages/dartz) : Functional programming in Dart.

## ðŸš€ Module Structure

![Clean Architecture](assets/CleanArchitecture.png)

There are 3 main modules to help separate the code. They are Data, Domain, and Presentaion.

- **Data** contains Local Storage, APIs, Data objects (Request/Response object, DB objects), and the
  repository implementation.

- **Domain** contains UseCases, Domain Objects/Models, and Repository Interfaces

- **Presentaion** contains UI, View Objects, Widgets, etc. Can be split into separate modules itself
  if needed. For example, we could have a module called Device handling things like camera,
  location, etc.

### Presentation (View)

- View,updates UI
